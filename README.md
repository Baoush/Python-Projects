# Python Projects Collection

A collection of various Python projects and experiments showcasing different programming concepts and techniques.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Random Spirals (`RandomSpirals.py`)
A colorful turtle graphics program that generates random spiral patterns.

**Features:**
- Creates 50 random spirals with different colors
- Uses turtle graphics for visual output
- Random positioning and sizing of spirals
- Colorful output with 8 different colors

**Usage:**
```bash
python RandomSpirals.py
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- Built-in `turtle` module

### 2. Pizza Cost Calculator (`Pizza.py`)
A simple pizza cost calculator that includes tax calculations.

**Features:**
- Calculates total cost based on number of pizzas and price per pizza
- Includes 8% sales tax calculation
- Displays subtotal, tax, and total cost
- User-friendly input prompts

**Usage:**
```bash
python Pizza.py
```

**Example Output:**
```
How many pizzas do you want? 2
How much does a pizza cost? 12.99
The total cost is £ 28.06
This includes £ 25.98 for the pizza and £ 2.08 for tax
```
